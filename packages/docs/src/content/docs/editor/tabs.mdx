import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Each query runs in its own tab. You can have multiple tabs open at once, rename them, and switch between them with keyboard shortcuts.

## Keyboard shortcuts

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Mac">

| Action | Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| New tab | `Cmd+T` |
| Close tab | `Cmd+W` |
| Jump to tab 1-9 | `Cmd+1` through `Cmd+9` |
| Next tab | `Cmd+Shift+]` |
| Previous tab | `Cmd+Shift+[` |

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Windows / Linux">

| Action | Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| New tab | `Ctrl+T` |
| Close tab | `Ctrl+W` |
| Jump to tab 1-9 | `Ctrl+1` through `Ctrl+9` |
| Next tab | `Ctrl+Shift+]` |
| Previous tab | `Ctrl+Shift+[` |

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Tab context menu

Right-click any tab to access additional actions:

- **Close other tabs** — close everything except the clicked tab
- **Close tabs to the right** — close all tabs after the clicked tab
- **Close tabs to the left** — close all tabs before the clicked tab
- **Close all tabs** — close every open tab

## Renaming tabs

Double-click a tab title to rename it. Giving tabs descriptive names makes it easier to keep track of what each query does.

## Unsaved changes

Seaquel warns you when you try to close a tab that has unsaved modifications, so you never accidentally lose work.
