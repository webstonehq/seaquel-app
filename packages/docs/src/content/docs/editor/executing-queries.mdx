## Multi-statement execution

Write multiple SQL statements separated by semicolons. Seaquel executes all of them in sequence:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT * FROM orders;
```

Each statement produces its own result set, displayed in separate panels below the editor.

## Understanding the output

After execution, you'll see for each statement:

- **Row count** — how many rows were returned or affected
- **Execution time** — how long the query took to run
- **Error messages** — if a statement fails, its error is shown inline without stopping subsequent statements

## EXPLAIN queries

Use the toolbar buttons to run EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN ANALYZE on your query. This shows the query execution plan without modifying the SQL in your editor — useful for diagnosing slow queries.
