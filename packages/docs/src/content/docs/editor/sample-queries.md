title: Sample Queries
description: Get started with pre-populated sample queries for each database type.
---

Seaquel includes sample queries for every supported database type so you can start exploring your data right away.

## What's included

Each database type comes with sample queries covering common SQL patterns:

- **SELECT** — basic column selection and filtering
- **JOINs** — inner, left, right, and cross joins
- **Aggregations** — GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM, AVG, and other aggregate functions
- **Subqueries** — nested queries and common table expressions (CTEs)

The samples are tailored to each database's dialect, so the syntax always matches your connection type.

## Accessing samples

Open the sample queries from the editor when starting a new query. Selecting a sample populates the editor with a ready-to-run query that you can execute as-is or modify to fit your schema.

## Learning by example

Sample queries are a practical way to:

- **Discover syntax** specific to your database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, DuckDB, or MSSQL)
- **Explore your schema** with useful starting points
- **Build new queries** by adapting a sample rather than starting from scratch
