Seaquel's AI assistant helps you write SQL by describing what you need in plain English. It understands your database schema and generates queries tailored to your actual tables and columns.

## Opening the AI assistant

- Click the **AI** button in the toolbar.
- Or open the command palette (`Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`) and search for "Toggle AI".

The assistant opens as a floating panel alongside your editor.

## How to use it

1. Open the AI assistant.
2. Type a question or describe the query you need.
3. The assistant generates SQL based on your prompt and schema.
4. Review the SQL and insert it into your editor.

## Example prompts

- "Find all users created in the last 30 days"
- "How can I optimize this query?"
- "Where is user email stored?"
- "Show me how to join orders with users"

## Features

- **Schema-aware** — the assistant knows your tables, columns, and relationships, so generated queries use correct names and types
- **Conversation history** — follow-up questions within a session build on previous context
- **Quick suggestions** — common prompt templates to get you started

## Good for

- Writing complex JOINs across multiple tables
