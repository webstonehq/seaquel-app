description: Keep Seaquel up to date with automatic updates.

Seaquel checks for updates automatically so you always have the latest features and fixes. This is a desktop app feature — updates are handled entirely within the application.

## Automatic update detection

When you launch Seaquel, it checks for new versions in the background. If an update is available, a notification appears in the app.

## Installing an update

1. Click the update notification when it appears.
2. Review the release notes for the new version.
3. Click **Install** to download and apply the update.

The update downloads and installs without leaving the app. Seaquel restarts automatically once the installation is complete.

## Checking manually

If you want to check for updates on demand:

1. Open **Settings** (`Cmd+,` / `Ctrl+,`).
2. Click **Check for Updates**.

## Release notes

Every update includes release notes describing what changed. You can also browse the full [changelog](/changelog/) on the Seaquel website.
