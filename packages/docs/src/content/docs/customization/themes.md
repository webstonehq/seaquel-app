## Changing your theme

1. Open **Settings** (`Cmd+,` / `Ctrl+,`).
2. Select a **Light theme** and a **Dark theme**.

## Custom themes

Create your own theme by modifying any of the 31 color tokens. All colors use the OKLch color space for perceptually uniform adjustments.

Color tokens include:

- **Base** — background, foreground, card, popover, muted
- **Accent** — primary, secondary, accent, destructive
- **UI** — border, input, ring
- **Charts** — 5 chart colors for data visualizations
- **Sidebar** — sidebar-specific background, foreground, primary, accent, border, and ring

### Creating a custom theme

1. Open **Settings** and scroll to **Themes**.
2. Click **Customize** on any built-in theme to use it as a starting point.
3. Adjust color tokens using the color picker.
4. Save your custom theme.
