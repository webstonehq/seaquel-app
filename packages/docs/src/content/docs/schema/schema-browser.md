title: Schema Browser
description: Navigate your database schema with the sidebar tree.
---

The schema browser lives in the left sidebar and gives you a tree view of every schema, table, and view in your database.

## Navigating the tree

- **Schemas** are top-level groups. Click to expand and see their tables and views.
- **Tables** and **views** are listed under each schema with distinct icons so you can tell them apart at a glance.
- **Row counts** are displayed next to each table.

## Quick actions

- **Click** a table to open a quick `SELECT` and preview its data.
- **Right-click** a table for additional options like inspecting columns, copying the table name, or dragging it onto the canvas.
- **Search** — use the filter field at the top of the sidebar to find tables by name. Results narrow as you type.

## Keyboard shortcut

Toggle the sidebar with `Cmd+B` (Mac) or `Ctrl+B` (Windows/Linux) to maximize editor space when you don't need it.
