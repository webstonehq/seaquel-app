description: Save, name, and organize frequently used queries.

Save queries you use often so you can find and re-run them without rewriting SQL from scratch. Saved queries are stored per-connection and accessible from the sidebar.

## Saving a query

1. Write your query in the editor.
2. Press `Cmd+S` (Mac) or `Ctrl+S` (Windows/Linux).
3. Enter a descriptive name for the query.
4. The query is saved to the current connection.

If the query uses [parameters](/docs/editor/query-parameters/), those are saved along with the SQL.

## Managing saved queries

Access your saved queries from the sidebar. Each entry shows:

- **Name** — your custom label
- **Created** — when the query was first saved
- **Modified** — when it was last updated

### Favorites

Star important queries to pin them to the top of the list. Click the star icon to toggle favorite status.

### Search and filter

Use the search field to filter saved queries by name or SQL content.

## Loading a saved query

Click any saved query to open it in a new tab. The full SQL text and any associated parameters are loaded into the editor.

## Updating a saved query

After modifying a saved query in the editor, press `Cmd+S` / `Ctrl+S` again to update it in place.
