After executing a query, results appear in a grid below the editor.

## Result grid

The grid displays your data in a table layout with:

- **Column headers** that show the column name and data type
- **Resizable columns** — drag column borders to adjust width
- **Sortable columns** — click a column header to sort ascending or descending

## Virtual scrolling

Seaquel uses virtual scrolling to render only the rows visible on screen. This means you can scroll through thousands of rows without any lag — the grid stays responsive regardless of result size.

## Pagination

Results are paginated for manageability. Use the controls at the bottom of the grid to:

1. Navigate between pages (first, previous, next, last).
2. Jump to a specific page number.
3. Change the page size — choose between 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, or 1000 rows per page.

## Multiple result sets

When you execute multiple statements, each one produces its own result panel. Switch between result sets using the tabs above the grid.
