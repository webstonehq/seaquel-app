Migrating from another database client? Seaquel can import your existing connections in one click.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="DBeaver">

## DBeaver import

Seaquel reads DBeaver's `data-sources.json` configuration file and extracts your connections.

1. Open **Settings** and find **Import Connections**.
2. Select **DBeaver**.
3. Seaquel locates the config file automatically, or you can browse to it manually.
4. Review the detected connections — each shows host, port, database, and username.
5. Check the connections you want to import (duplicates are detected and flagged).
6. Click **Import**.

Supported provider types: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, DuckDB, MSSQL.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="TablePlus">

## TablePlus import

Seaquel reads TablePlus's `Connections.plist` file.

1. Open **Settings** and find **Import Connections**.
2. Select **TablePlus**.
3. Seaquel locates the plist file, or you can browse to it manually.
4. Review the detected connections with database type, host, and name.
5. Check the connections you want to import (duplicates are detected).
6. Click **Import**.

Driver types are automatically mapped to Seaquel's database types.

After importing, you may need to re-enter passwords — Seaquel cannot read credentials from other applications' keychains for security reasons.
