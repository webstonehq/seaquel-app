Projects help you group related connections together — by team, client, application, or however you organize your work.

## Creating a project

1. Open the project selector in the sidebar.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Give it a name and optional description.
4. Assign connections to the project.

## Default project

Connections that aren't assigned to a specific project live in the **Default** project. You can always move them later.

## Connection labels

Labels give you a quick visual indicator of what environment a connection points to.

### Built-in labels

| Label | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Local** | Development databases on your machine |
| **Staging** | Pre-production environments |
| **Production** | Live production databases |

Each label has a distinct color for at-a-glance recognition.

### Custom labels

Create your own labels with custom names and colors to match your workflow. Useful for labeling by team, client, region, or any other grouping.

## Switching projects

Switch between projects in the sidebar. Only connections for the active project are shown, keeping the sidebar clean when you have many connections.
