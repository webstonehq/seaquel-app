description: Build analysis workflows on an infinite visual canvas.

The canvas is Seaquel's signature feature — an infinite visual workspace where you build analysis pipelines by connecting nodes together. It's powered by XYFlow and designed for exploring data interactively.

## Node types

The canvas supports four node types that chain together into pipelines:

- **Table nodes** — display table metadata including columns with types, nullability, defaults, primary key and foreign key indicators, indexes, and row count.
- **Query nodes** — SQL editor nodes with a name, SQL text, execution state, and execution time.
- **Result nodes** — display query output with columns, rows, and pagination. Connected to a query node.
- **Chart nodes** — visualize results as charts. Connected to a result node.

## Building a pipeline

1. Drag a table from the schema browser onto the canvas to create a table node.
2. Add a query node and write SQL referencing that table.
3. Execute the query — a result node appears automatically with your data.
4. Add a chart node connected to the result to visualize the output.

When upstream data changes, all downstream nodes update automatically. Edit a query and re-run it — the result and chart nodes refresh in place.

## Working with the canvas

- **Pan**: click and drag the background, or use two-finger scroll.
- **Zoom**: pinch to zoom or use the zoom controls in the toolbar.
- **Connect nodes**: drag from a node's output handle to another node's input handle.
- **Move nodes**: click and drag any node to reposition it.

Canvas state saves automatically and persists across sessions. Your workflows are always where you left them.

## Use cases

- Build multi-step analysis workflows visually
- Compare results across related queries side by side
- Create reusable dashboards with charts that update on demand
- Explore unfamiliar schemas by dragging tables onto the canvas and inspecting their structure
