description: Generate interactive Entity Relationship Diagrams from your database.

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The ERD viewer generates an interactive Entity Relationship Diagram directly from your database schema. It shows tables, columns, and foreign key relationships in a visual layout.

## Opening the ERD

1. Open the command palette with `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux).
2. Search for **View ERD Diagram**.
3. The diagram generates from your current connection.

## Navigating the diagram

- **Pan**: click and drag the background.
- **Zoom**: scroll to zoom in and out, or use the zoom controls.
- **Search**: use the search field to find tables by name.
- **Schema filter**: show or hide specific schemas to focus on the tables you care about.

Each table node displays its columns with data types, and badges for primary keys and foreign keys. Foreign key relationships appear as connections between tables.

The toolbar shows the total **table count** and **relationship count** for quick reference.

## Exporting

The ERD viewer supports multiple export formats:

- **Download as PNG** — raster image for documents and presentations
- **Download as SVG** — vector image that scales cleanly at any size
- **Copy to clipboard as PNG** — paste directly into other apps
- **Copy to clipboard as SVG** — paste as vector into design tools

<Aside>
SVG exports are ideal for documentation — they stay sharp at any zoom level and have smaller file sizes than PNG for diagram content.
