description: Learn SQL interactively with progressive lessons and challenges.
---

Seaquel includes a built-in SQL curriculum that teaches you from the basics through advanced topics. Every lesson runs against a [practice database](/docs/learn-sql/practice-database/) — no external setup needed.

## Accessing tutorials

1. Open the sidebar and select **SQL Sandbox**.
2. Or press `Cmd+K` (Mac) / `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) and search for "SQL Sandbox".

## Curriculum

The tutorials cover these topics in order:

1. **Introduction to SQL** — what databases are, basic terminology
2. **SELECT statements** — retrieving data from tables
3. **WHERE clauses** — filtering rows with conditions
4. **JOINs** — combining data from multiple tables (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
5. **GROUP BY and aggregates** — COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX
6. **HAVING clauses** — filtering grouped results
7. **ORDER BY** — sorting output
8. **Subqueries** — nesting queries inside queries
9. **Window functions** — ROW_NUMBER, RANK, running totals
10. **Common Table Expressions** — writing readable queries with CTEs

## How lessons work

Each lesson introduces a concept with a brief explanation, then presents progressive challenges. You write SQL in the editor, and Seaquel validates your queries in real time using SQL AST parsing — it checks the structure of your query, not just the output.

Challenges build on each other within a lesson. Complete one to unlock the next.
