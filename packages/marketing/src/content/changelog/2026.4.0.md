## Learn SQL

**Interactive Tutorials** — A built-in learning system with structured lessons covering SELECT, WHERE, JOINs, aggregates, and more. Each lesson includes progressive challenges that validate your queries in real time.

**Visual Query Builder Sandbox** — A drag-and-drop canvas where you can build queries visually by placing table nodes, connecting JOINs, and configuring filters — all while seeing the generated SQL update live.

**Built-in Practice Database** — An e-commerce sample database is included so you can start learning immediately without setting up your own data.

---

## Shared Query Library

**Git-Synced Repositories** — Share SQL queries across your team with Git-backed query repositories. Push and pull query collections to keep everyone in sync.

**Managed Repositories** — Browse, search, and organize shared queries directly from the Manage panel.

---

## Query Builder Enhancements

**Aggregate Functions** — Add COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX aggregates per column from the filter panel or directly on table nodes in the canvas.

**Variable Support** — Use `{{variables}}` in WHERE filter values and LIMIT inputs for reusable parameterized queries.

**Boolean Operators** — Toggle between AND/OR operators in WHERE clauses for more expressive filters.

**SELECT * Expansion** — Expand wildcard selects into explicit column lists with one click.

**Two-Way SQL Sync** — Edit SQL directly or use the visual builder — changes sync both ways in real time.

---

## Windows Support

**Native Windows Builds** — Seaquel is now available on Windows with MSI installers for both x64 and ARM architectures.

**Code Signing** — Windows builds are signed with Azure Trusted Signing for a smooth installation experience without security warnings.
