This release fixes DuckDB extension loading on macOS, adds proper handling for utility statements, and improves the tab layout.

## DuckDB Extension Loading

**macOS Compatibility Fix** — DuckDB extensions (like `aws`, `httpfs`, `spatial`, etc.) now load correctly on macOS. Previously, macOS code signing validation blocked third-party extensions from loading within Seaquel. The app now includes the necessary entitlements to allow DuckDB's extension autoloading to work as expected.

---

## Utility Statement Handling

**SET, PRAGMA, CREATE & More** — Utility and DDL statements are now handled as a distinct category instead of being forced through the SELECT or write-query paths. Statements like `SET` and `PRAGMA` execute cleanly without producing empty result tabs, and when mixed with SELECT statements in a multi-statement query, only the meaningful results are displayed.

---

## Improvements

- Moved connection tabs from the header bar into the content area below the sidebar for a cleaner layout
- Fixed page size not being preserved correctly when switching between utility and SELECT results
