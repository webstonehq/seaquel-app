This release introduces project-based organization, connection labels, and helpful starter tabs for new users.

## Projects

**Project Organization** — Group your database connections into projects for better organization. Create projects for different applications, clients, or environments.

**Per-Project State** — Each project maintains its own tabs, active views, and UI state. Switch between projects without losing your work context.

**Automatic Migration** — Existing connections are automatically migrated to a default project, so you can start organizing right away.

## Connection Labels

**Environment Labels** — Tag connections with labels like Local, Staging, or Production to quickly identify environments at a glance.

**Custom Colors** — Choose from predefined colors or create custom labels to match your workflow and team conventions.

---

## Starter Tabs

**Getting Started** — New users see a helpful getting-started tab when no connection is active, making first-time setup easier.

**Migration Tips** — Guidance for users migrating from other database clients, helping them get up to speed quickly.

---

## Improvements

- Fixed text overflow on long database names in connection cards
- Demo mode now protects the demo connection from accidental deletion
