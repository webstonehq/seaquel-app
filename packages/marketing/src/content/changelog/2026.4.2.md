This release adds TablePlus connection import and fixes data editing for typed PostgreSQL columns.

---

## TablePlus Import

**One-Click Migration** — Import your existing database connections from TablePlus, mirroring the DBeaver import feature introduced in v2026.1.1. Connections are parsed from the macOS plist file and surfaced through the same import dialog.

---

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed PostgreSQL UPDATE and INSERT failing on typed columns (timestamp, date, boolean, etc.) — parameterized values are now explicitly cast to the target column type
- Improved SSH tunnel error messages to be more readable and actionable
