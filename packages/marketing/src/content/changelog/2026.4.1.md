A patch release fixing auto-update delivery on Windows and aligning Tauri package versions.

---

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed automatic updates not being offered to Windows users — the Windows build was transforming the version number for MSI compatibility (e.g. 2026.4.0 to 26.4.0), which leaked into the updater manifest and caused it to incorrectly skip the update
- Fixed mismatched Tauri NPM package versions to match their corresponding Rust crate versions
