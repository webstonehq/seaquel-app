                    <p>
                        By accessing the Seaquel website ("Website") or
                        downloading, installing, or using the Seaquel software
                        ("Software"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of
                        Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms,

                            <strong>"Software"</strong> means the Seaquel

                        </li>

                            <strong>"Website"</strong> means the Seaquel
                            marketing website and any associated web services.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>"License"</strong> means the right to use
                            the Software under the applicable license terms.

                        <li>
                            <strong>"Commercial Use"</strong> means any use of
                            the Software in connection with a business,

                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>3. License Grant</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Software source code is released under the MIT
                        License and is free to use for personal,
                        non-commercial purposes. You may view, modify, and
                        distribute the source code in accordance with the MIT
                        License terms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Commercial Use of the Software requires a valid
                        commercial license purchased through the Website. Using
                        the Software for Commercial Use without a valid license
                        is a violation of these Terms.
                    </p>

                    <h2>4. Commercial License Terms</h2>
                    <p>
                        Commercial licenses are offered as annual
                        subscriptions in two tiers:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Individual License</strong> &mdash; for a
                            single person using the Software commercially.
                            Permits activation on one device. Not
                            transferable to another person.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Business License</strong> &mdash; for
                            teams and organizations. Sold on a per-seat basis.
                            Each seat permits activation on one device. Seats
                            are transferable: you may deactivate a seat and
                            reassign it to a different team member at no
                            additional cost.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        When a commercial license expires, you retain the right
                        to use the version of the Software that was current at
                        the time of expiration. You will no longer receive
                        updates or new versions until you renew.
                    </p>

                    <h2>5. Payment and Billing</h2>
                    <p>
                        All payments are processed by our third-party payment
                        provider, Dodo Payments. By making a purchase, you agree
                        to Dodo Payments' terms of service. Webstone does not
                        store your payment card details.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Commercial licenses are billed annually. Prices are
                        listed on the Website and may change. Any price changes
                        will take effect at your next renewal, not during a
                        current subscription period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All sales are final. Refunds are provided at our sole
                        discretion and only in exceptional circumstances.
                        Contact us if you believe a refund is warranted.
                    </p>

                    <h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>
                    <p>You agree not to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Circumvent, disable, or tamper with the license
                            activation or validation mechanisms of the Software.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Share, distribute, or publish your license key for
                            others to use.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Redistribute the Software as your own product or
                            under a different name without clear attribution.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use the Website or Software in any way that violates
                            applicable laws or regulations.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,
                        Webstone Technologies Inc. shall not be liable for any
                        indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
